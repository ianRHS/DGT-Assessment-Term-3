        <h2>Fishing</h2>
        <p>Fiordland has a range of fishing opportunities to suit all anglers,
            <br> with lakes and rivers offering good numbers of brown and rainbow trout.
            <br> There is water to suit anglers of all abilities, including Lake Henry
            <br> in the Ivon Wilson Park in Te Anau which is specially stocked for children to try angling.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Boat trips</h2>
        <p>
            The deeply carved glacial valleys of Fiordland have created spectacular
            <br> landscapes ideal for experiencing by boat, whether it be a fishing trip on one of the lakes,
            <br> a scenic cruise in one of the fiords, or an exhilarating jet boat ride up a river.
